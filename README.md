## Functional JavaScript workshop

> Learn functional programming in JavaScript with a NodeSchool workshop! https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop.

### To start the workshop

You'll need Node installed. Then, from the command line:

```sh
# To install the workshop:
npm install -g functional-javascript-workshop
# Then, to run the workshop:
functional-javascript
```

### What did we learn?

- For loops conflate three separate kinds of operations: filtering (`Array#filter`), reduction (`Array#reduce`) and transformation (`Array#map`).
- [Higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) (functions that take other functions as parameter) are very common in JavaScript.
- JavaScript's [Array "extras"](https://dev.opera.com/articles/javascript-array-extras-in-detail/) methods (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc) are quite cool!

### To go further

- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), the most used "functional programming helpers" library.
- Good read on the topic of [FP and FP in JavaScript from MDN](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/01/from-mapreduce-to-javascript-functional-programming/)
- What are `.bind`, `.apply` and `.call`? [Partial Application in JavaScript](http://benalman.com/news/2012/09/partial-application-in-javascript/)

## Unit Testing workshop

> Learn to test anything with TAP! https://github.com/finnp/test-anything.

### To start the workshop

You'll need Node installed. Then, from the command line:

```sh
# To install the workshop:
npm install -g test-anything
# Then, to run the workshop:
test-anything
```
